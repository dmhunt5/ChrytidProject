# Introduction

This game is a fast paced 2d platformer focused on close combat, movement, and a power progression menu (PPM). As of now, the PPM is under development to allow users to unlock certain sidegrades
  and or flat out upgrades to movesets. It will be an open world story driven platformer with difficult combat. 

# Playability

At this current state, the game is functioning and playable only on the engine. However, I am working on making it playable by building it on your own PC. Updates to this will appear here. 

Currently, there are no actual assets included in this version as they are all still under development. However, some of the concept art will be included in a separate folder titled "FUTURE"

# Code and Engine

This project is being built on the Godot game engine using its own built in language, GDScript.

# Future

- Combat system full functionality
- Enemy AI
