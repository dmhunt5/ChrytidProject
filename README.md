# Introduction

This game is a fast paced 2d platformer focused on close combat, movement, and a power progression menu (PPM). As of now, the PPM is under development to allow users to unlock certain sidegrades
  and or flat out upgrades to movesets. It will be an open world story driven platformer with difficult combat. 

# Playability

At this current state, the game is functioning and playable only on the engine. However, I am working on making it playable by building it on your own PC. Updates to this will appear here. 

Currently, there are no actual assets included in this version as they are all still under development. However, the concept art of the main character will be included in a separate folder titled "FUTURE" as well as posted lower on this page.
  all the credit fo the art goes to my friend Derp :)
